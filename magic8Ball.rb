  Conditions Of Programming - Poem by Lawrence S. Pertillar
  Autoplay next video If you want to wear those shoes, 
  Put them on.
  There is no agreement of purposes, 
  In the first place.
  You will do as you wish.
  And I know this! 
  
  If you want to declare you are right, 
  When wrong stares me in the face.
  And you want me to believe, 
  What you perceive.
  Do it! 
  There is no argument.
  
  Whatever you choose to do from now on...
  That is up to you.
  Conditions of programming, 
  Have been accepted as they are! 
  You see things as you wish them to exist.
  And I choose to refrain from becoming a conformist.
  
  However...
  Let's come to admit, 
  We are both in conflict...
  With the current nonsense that is being dished! 
  And getting out of it provides neither one of us an exit! ".yellow
